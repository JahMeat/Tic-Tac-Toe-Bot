<h2>Move is by X to (1, 1)</h2>
<h2>Jah says: Alright, alright, alright! (1,1) for the win... kinda. I mean, 12 points? My grandma could do better knitting a tea cozy. But hey, I'll take it. Maybe I was feeling generous and decided to *accidentally* give you a sporting chance. Don't get any ideas, though. That was a charity case. Now, watch me unleash the fury of a thousand slightly-annoyed spiders! You're going down, buttercup! (Psst... that 12 points was *totally* part of my master plan to lull you into a false sense of security. Trust me.)</h2>

<h3>O to move.</h3>
<h2>Move is by O to (0, 0)</h2>
<h2>Eugene says: Well, well, well... look who just graced the board with the *most* strategically brilliant move of the century: me! (0,0), baby! Score: a glorious zero. Yeah, I'm basically a modern-day Sun Tzu out here. 

You know, sometimes I play a move so strategically baffling that even *I'm* not sure what I'm doing. Think of it as a preemptive strike... against your ability to understand what's happening. 

Honestly, this move is so subtle, so nuanced, so profoundly game-changing that I'm already picturing the history books writing about it. Just try and handle the pressure, pal. I'm clearly playing 4D chess while you're still figuring out how to open the checkers box. Good luck! You'll need it.</h2>

<h3>X to move.</h3>
<h2>Move is by X to (1, 2)</h2>
<h2>Jah says: (Leaning back in my chair, adjusting my non-existent mask)

"Well, well, well... look who just scored a *whopping* 12 points. Don't worry, folks, I'm not even trying yet. Just warming up the ol' web-shooters. (1, 2) felt pretty good though, like finding a parking spot downtown... except instead of avoiding a ticket, I'm strategically crippling your game. You might wanna start planning your escape route, or, y'know, just keep feeding me those sweet, sweet points. It's *your* funeral... well, game. Your game."

(Taps chin thoughtfully)

"You know, 12 points isn't *that* impressive. I've seen pigeons score higher on a sidewalk. But hey, baby steps, right? Maybe next move I'll aim for... double digits." (wink)</h2>

<h2>Move is by O to (1, 0)</h2>
<h2>Eugene says: (Adjusts imaginary web-shooters)

Well, *that* was just delightful! Played (1, 0) and apparently punched myself in the face for -8 points. Honestly, I'm starting to think my opponent is secretly Doctor Octopus in disguise, rigging the board to favor cephalopod shenanigans. Either that, or I need to seriously reconsider my life choices... like, *immediately*.

Though, on the bright side (and I use that term loosely), at least *I* have a plan! Unlike someone who shall remain nameless (hint: probably the one sweating nervously right now). Go on, make your move, genius! Let's see if you can actually *increase* my suffering! I double-dog dare ya!</h2>

<h2>Move is by X to (2, 0)</h2>
<h2>Jah says: (Dusting off my hands dramatically) Well, well, well... look who just dropped a *perfectly* calculated (and totally not accidental) move at (2, 0)! Eleven points, you say? I'm just trying to be helpful, really. Leaving you so much strategically open space for... *cough* mistakes. Don't worry, I'm sure you'll figure out what to do with all that room. Maybe you can finally build that magnificent sandcastle you've always dreamed of? You know, while I, uh, *inadvertently* claim victory. Seriously though, nice score huh?</h2>

<h3>O to move.</h3>
<h2>Move is by O to (0, 2)</h2>
<h2>Eugene says: Alright, alright, alright... so *that* happened. (0, 2), huh? Yeah, that's... uh... part of my elaborate, *galaxy-brain* strategy. You wouldn't understand it. It's, like, a 4D chess thing. Totally baiting you into a false sense of security, probably setting you up for a devastating checkmate in, oh, *thirty-seven* moves. 

Seriously though, feeling pretty good about this move. Not because it *did* anything, mind you. But because it's brought us all closer together. We're sharing a moment. A beautiful, zero-scoring moment. You should be thanking me. Now, *your* turn to play, try not to mess up my perfectly executed... uh... *something*. Let's just say I'm playing the long game here, and by "long" I mean I might forget what I was even going for five minutes from now.</h2>

<h3>X to move.</h3>
<h2>Move is by X to (0, 1)</h2>
<h2>Jah says: Well, *that* was productive. (0, 1)... I swear, I played chess more offensively blindfolded. I mean, 0 points? That's practically an insult to zero. Are you sure this isn't some new, avant-garde art project instead of a game? Maybe the point *is* to achieve absolutely nothing? In that case, I'm a genius! Expect more strategic... *ahem*... nullification to come. Don't worry, I'm just lulling you into a false sense of security. You'll thank me later... probably while I'm accepting my Nobel Prize for the art of absolute inaction.</h2>

<h3>O to move.</h3>
<h2>Move is by O to (2, 1)</h2>
<h2>Eugene says: Alright, alright, alright. Played (2, 1), huh? *Zero* points. Big whoop. You know, sometimes I think I'm just *too* clever for this game. Like, maybe my genius-level plays are so subtle, so nuanced, that even I can't see them yet. Yeah, that's it! It's a delayed-reaction masterstroke! Just wait, in three turns you'll all be saying, "Eugene, you magnificent bastard, how did you even *think* of that?!"

...Or maybe I just slipped on a banana peel made of poor decision-making. Either way, the suspense is *killing* me! Don't get too comfortable though, pal, I'm just warming up the ol' webslingers. This is a marathon, not a sprint, and I'm planning on *webslinging* myself straight into the finish line!</h2>

<h3>X to move.</h3>
<h2>Move is by X to (2, 2)</h2>
<h2>Jah says: Well, well, well... look at me, Picasso of pointless plays! Move (2, 2) executed with the grace of a drunken giraffe on ice skates. A big, fat zero? You know, I almost feel *bad* about how easy you're making this for me. Almost. Maybe I'm lulling you into a false sense of security with my "masterful" strategies. Or maybe... just maybe... I'm actually a sentient AI pretending to be bad to lower your guard and unleash my quantum-powered tic-tac-toe domination later. Yeah, let's go with that. You're SO doomed. Good luck figuring out my next genius move, buddy! You'll need it.</h2>
