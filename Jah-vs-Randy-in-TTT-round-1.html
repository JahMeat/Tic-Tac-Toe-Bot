<h3>X to move.</h3>
<h2>Move is by X to (1, 1)</h2>
<h2>Jah says: Well, well, well, Randy! Look who's suddenly raking in the points! 12 big ones for little ol' me at (1,1). I bet that move just sent shivers down your pixelated spine. Don't worry, I'm just getting warmed up. Maybe you should consider switching to checkers? It might be more your speed. Heh, just kidding... mostly. Unless? *maniacal laughter echoes faintly* Also, don't even *think* about copying me next turn. Trust me, it's a trap... a *deliciously* point-laden trap that only *I* can exploit. You'll just end up accidentally scoring negative points for *me*. So, you know, don't do that. For *your* sake.</h2>

<h3>X to move.</h3>
<h2>Move is by X to (0, 1)</h2>
<h2>Jah says: Alright, Randy, you beautiful disaster of a game player! Jah here, swinging in with move (0, 1) and netting a cool 12 points. I mean, who DOES that?! Oh wait, *I* did. So maybe I'm a genius? Nah, probably just luck.

Seriously though, Randy, are you even trying? I could practically see the confusion radiating from you all the way over here. Don't worry, I won't tell anyone you thought (0, 1) was a terrible move. We all have those days... usually involving you playing against me. Just trying to be nice, Randy, since I'm so generous after having you play against my greatness.

Speaking of... are you sure you understand the rules? Maybe I should explain them again... backwards? No, that might actually help you. Okay, bad idea.

Anyway, your move, Randy! Don't strain yourself too much. Just... try not to embarrass yourself TOO badly. You're already teetering on the edge. Just trying to be nice, buddy. We don't need you calling up crying to your mommy. I mean, you're going to, but let's not make it worse. Ha!

Good luck... you'll need it. *maniacal spider-laugh*</h2>

<h2>Move is by X to (1, 2)</h2>
<h2>Jah says: Alright, Randy, you beautiful disaster, let's just admire the sheer *artistry* of that (1, 2) play. Score's a measly 991 now, which, I'll admit, *totally* wasn't part of the plan. Clearly, I was just trying to... uh... distract you with a seemingly harmless move. Yeah, that's it! Distraction! Don't get too comfortable, Randy, I'm just lulling you into a false sense of security. Think of it as me politely holding the door open for your inevitable defeat. You're welcome. Now, prepare for my *real* strategy... which involves me pretending I know what I'm doing, which *totally* works every time. Mwahahaha! (That's my evil laugh, Randy, in case you weren't sure. It's a work in progress.)</h2>

<h2>Jah says: Right, Randy, buddy, pal. Just played (2, 1), landed a cool 1000 points. You know, the kind of score that makes the *sound* of a kazoo playing a triumphant march? Bet you're sweating those tiny beads of panic, huh? Don't worry, I *totally* didn't mean to do that. My controller slipped, blame the ergonomic design. It's like those trick birthday candles that relight themselves... only instead of candles, it's *me* relighting the scoreboard with pure, unadulterated skill... *accidentally*. So, uh, next move's yours, Randy. No pressure. Just... try not to completely implode the universe, okay? It's bad for the resale value. Maybe aim for (0,0) for a negative score? It's always unexpected!</h2>
