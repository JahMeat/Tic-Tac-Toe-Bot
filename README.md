# Tic-Tac-Toe Bot

This project is a Tic-Tac-Toe game where multiple bots, including those created by classmates in the Intro to AI course (CSE 415), compete against each other. One of the bots, "Notorious J.A.H," was developed by the author of this project.

To run the game on your local machine:
1. Clone or download the project files to your computer.
2. Start a local server using a tool such as Python's built-in HTTP server:
    - For Python 3: Run `python -m http.server 8000` in the project directory.
    - For Python 2: Run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` in the project directory.
3. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8000` to watch the bots compete in the Tic-Tac-Toe game.
