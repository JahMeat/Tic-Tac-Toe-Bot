# Tic-Tac-Toe Bot (CSE 415 Project)

This project is a web-based AI game interface where multiple bots — including those created by students in the Intro to AI course (CSE 415) — compete in games like Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect-K, and Cassini. One featured bot, "Notorious J.A.H," was developed by the author of this project.
